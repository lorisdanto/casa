"""Draw one index from a categorical given in log space, without the failure modes of
``torch.multinomial``.

Why this exists. On the CPU, ``torch.multinomial(p, 1)`` without replacement runs an exponential
race: every entry is divided by an ``Exp(1)`` draw and the largest quotient wins. An exponential
draw that comes back exactly zero turns its entry into infinity, and that entry wins whatever its
probability was. Over a 128k-token vocabulary that is one uniformly random token roughly every
hundred and thirty steps, which is invisible in a unit test on ten categories and ruinous in a
forty-token answer: a fifth of the words MARS produced were outside the input list, its own
accounting scored those sequences at a mean log-probability of -236, and the SMC baseline, which
samples the identical ratios through numpy in float64, was clean.

Inverse-CDF sampling in float64 has no such path. A zero-probability entry has the same cumulative
value as its predecessor, so it can never be the first index whose cumulative value exceeds the
uniform draw. The uniform comes from torch's global CPU generator, so seeding is unchanged.
