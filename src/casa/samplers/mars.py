"""Multi-model Adaptive Rejection Sampling.

MARS draws exact samples from any target that admits an envelope: combinations of language models
built with :mod:`casa.algebra`, including intersections, agreement and coverage ensembles,
sharpening, reweighting, and hard constraints.

It is CARS with one thing generalized. CARS stores, at each visited prefix, the model's next-token
distribution masked by grammar validity; the mask is 1 on valid tokens and 0 on invalid ones, and a
rejection sets an entry to 0 and propagates the shrunken mass to the parent. MARS stores the
*envelope ratio* ``log E(ua) - log E(u)`` instead of that masked distribution. Everything else, the
trie, the propagation, the telescoping argument, is unchanged, and a hard constraint makes the
ratio factor back into "model conditional times validity mask", which is CARS exactly.

Two consequences worth knowing. A rejection can now be partial: where CARS discovers an invalid
continuation by drawing it, MARS flips one coin at the moment a prefix is first expanded, with
survival probability equal to the total child mass over the parent's bound, and never draws the
token at all. And no rejection ever happens at a leaf, because the envelope is exact on complete
sequences, so once a descent reaches the end-of-sequence token the sample is accepted.

    """Exact sampling from a combination of language models.

    Args:
        target: A :class:`casa.algebra.Envelope`, or a :class:`casa.algebra.Potential` which is
            validated on the spot. Passing a potential with no envelope raises ``NoEnvelope``,
            naming the obstruction.
        max_new_tokens: Length bound.
        verbose: Print a progress line per sample.
        temperature: Applied to every model's logits before the envelope is formed.
        on_max_length: What a prefix that reaches the bound does.

            ``"stop"`` (the default) ends it, as if the models had produced the end-of-sequence
            marker with probability one. The target is then the combination truncated to this
            length, which is the model the paper assumes when it says termination can be enforced
            by a maximum length.

            ``"discard"`` throws the descent away instead. That is also exact, for the target
            conditioned on terminating within the bound, but every language model a few tokens
            into a sentence wants to keep going, so nearly every descent is wasted and a short
            bound can return nothing at all after doing all the work.
        adaptive: Whether to keep what each rejection teaches.

            ``False`` starts every descent from the original envelope, discarding the tightened
            bounds. That is plain rejection sampling from the same envelope: same target, same
            exactness, same per-descent behaviour, but nothing is remembered, so the acceptance
            rate never moves. It is the baseline the adaptive claim is measured against, and the
            only difference between the two is whether the trie survives a descent.
        cache: With ``adaptive=False`` only: keep every expanded prefix's envelope ratios across
            descents, but never tighten a bound. That is rejection sampling with the same prefix
            cache MARS has, so a revisited prefix costs no forward pass, and the survival coin is
            flipped again from the stored ratios on every visit, as plain rejection sampling
            would flip it. Against MARS this isolates what the learned bounds buy from what the
            cache buys; on a target that never rejects the two are the same algorithm.

        ``raw_logprob`` is ``log phi(w$)``, the target's own unnormalized weight. The ratios stored
        in the trie telescope to ``log E(w$)``, which equals it by condition (i) for every target
        except the coverage regime, where MARS runs on a dominating envelope; there the difference
        is the leaf gap, which varies from sequence to sequence and is added back here. Getting
        that wrong makes every reweighting or divergence computed from these numbers wrong too.

        ``constrained_logprob`` is the same quantity relative to the envelope at the root. Note
        that CARS puts the descent's own log-probability in this field, which is a different thing:
        it differs from this by the current root mass.

        Neither costs a model call; both come from values already in hand.
